# Online-Bidding-Website
I developed an online bidding website using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, focusing on both the front-end structure and the core bidding functionality. I started by designing the site layout with HTML5, creating separate sections for product listings, bid details, timers, and user interactions. Each auction item was organized using semantic tags to keep the structure clean and easy to maintain. Next, I implemented a responsive and modern UI using CSS3, applying flexbox and grid layouts to ensure the site adapts smoothly across devices. I also added hover effects, color themes, and basic animations to improve the overall user experience and highlight the changing bid values. The core logic of the bidding system was built using JavaScript. I implemented real-time price updates by capturing user inputs, validating bid amounts, and updating the DOM dynamically. Each auction item included a countdown timer, created with JavaScripts time functions, which automatically closed the bidding once the timer reached zero. Events such as button clicks and timer updates were managed through event listeners to ensure smooth interaction. Overall, this project helped me strengthen my skills in front-end development, DOM manipulation, event-driven programming, and UI/UX design, while building a functional mini auction system from scratch.
